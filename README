Module 3 Challenge
Welcome to the world of Python! In this challenge I completed two Python challenge, PyBank and PyPoll. Both challenges represent real-world situations to put my new Python skills to work!

First, I created a repository called Python-Challenge and cloned it to my computer and created folders for each challenge: PyBank and PyPoll and included the necessary files and folders for the resources and Analysis

In the PyBank Challenge I analyzed financial records for a given dataset composed of a column of "Date" and Profit/Losses". I then created a script that analyzed the records to find the following info:

- the total number of months inlcuded within the dataset
- the net total amount of profit/losses over the time period
- the changes of profit/losses over the time period and the average of those changes
- the greatest increase in profits (data and amount) over the entire period
- the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Then I printed the results to the terminal and exported a text file with the results as well. 


On to the PyPoll challenge! In this challenge, I helped a small town modernize its vote counting process. I looked at their poll data composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County" , and "Candidate" and created a script that analyzes those votes and calculates the following:

- the total number of votes
- a list of candidates who received votes
- the percentage of votes that each candidate received
- the total number of votes each candidate won
- and the winner of the election based on the popular vote!

Then I printed the results to the terminal and exported a test file with the results as well. 


Hooray!
